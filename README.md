# Seadragon

My take on a simple drag and drop program utilizing GTK4.

## Building

To build the application you will need GTK4 (on Arch it can be installed with `gtk4`)

```
make dragon
```

## Usage

Simply run compiled `dragon` providing it files which you
want to drag and drop.

```
./dragon main.c README.md
```
